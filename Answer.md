Question 1 -
Answer-   Based on the  table structure, the relationship between the “Product” and “Product Category” entities can be inferred from the columns in the tables.
        In the “product” table, there is  a column named category_id, which likely serves as a foreign key referencing the id column in the “product_category” table. This column establishes a link between each 
       product and its corresponding category.

		Each product in the “product” table is associated with a specific category through the category_id column.
		The category_id column in the “product” table holds the ID of the category to which the product belongs.
		In the “product_category” table, the id column uniquely identifies each category.
		By referencing the id column of the “product_category” table through the category_id column in the “product” table, you establish a relationship between products and their respective categories.
 
  The relationship between the “Product” and “Product Category” entities is established through the category_id column in the “product” table, which references the primary key (id) column in the “product_category” table. This allows you to associate each product with a specific category.
